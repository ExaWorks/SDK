    "<img src=\"./images/psij_overview.png\" width=\"350\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "PSI/J automatically translates abstract job specifications into concrete scripts and commands to send to the scheduler. PSI/J has a number of advantages:\n",
    "1. **Runs entirely in user space**: no need to wait for infrequent deployment cycles, it's easy to leverage built-in or community-provided plugins\n",
    "2. **An asynchronous modern API for job management**: a clean Python API for requesting and managing jobs.\n",
    "3. **Supports the common batch schedulers**: we test PSI/J across multiple DOE supercomputer centers. It’s easy to test PSI/J on your systems and share the results with the community.\n",
    "4. **Built by the HPC community, for the HPC community**: PSI/J is based on a number of libraries used by state-of-the-art HPC workflow applications.\n",
    "5. **PSI/J is an open source project**: we are establishing a community to develop, test, and deploy PSI/J across many HPC facilities."

    "## Overview \n",
    "In PSI/J’s terminology, a [Job](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/#docs/.generated/psij.html/#psij.job.Job) represents an executable plus a bunch of attributes. Static job attributes such as resource requirements are defined by the [JobSpec](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/#docs/.generated/psij.html/#psij.job_spec.JobSpec) at creation. Dynamic job attributes such as the [JobState](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/#docs/.generated/psij.html/#psij.job_state.JobState) are modified by [JobExecutors](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/#docs/.generated/psij.html/#psij.job_executor.JobExecutor) as the [Job](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/#docs/.generated/psij.html/#psij.job.Job) progresses through its lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [JobExecutor](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/#docs/.generated/psij.html/#psij.job_executor.JobExecutor) represents a specific *Resource Manager*, e.g. Slurm, on which the Job is being executed. Available *Resource Managers*: \n",
    "- Local\n",
    "- Cobalt\n",
    "- Flux\n",
    "- LSF\n",
    "- PBS\n",
    "- Slurm\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, when jobs are submitted, they will be queued for a variable period of time, depending on how busy the target machine is. Once the Job is started, its executable is launched and runs to completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PSI/J, a job is submitted by [JobExecutor.submit(Job)](https://exaworks.org/psij-python/#docs/.generated/psij.html/#psij.job_executor.JobExecutor) which permanently binds the Job to that executor and submits it to the underlying resource manager."
